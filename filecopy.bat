rem Set this path to your mod directory. You can use environment variables to avoid hardcoding the path if your team members have different install locations.
set mod_directory=C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/Half-Life/halflife_op4_updated

rem Input paths may end with a backslash which will be interpreted as an escape character when passed into robocopy, so this needs to be escaped.
set source=%~1
set source=%source:\=\\%
set destination=%mod_directory%/%~2
set destination=%destination:\=\\%
set filename=%~3

echo Installing "%destination%/%filename%"

rem If you are having problems with this command, remove the redirect to nul part (> nul) to get error messages from robocopy.
@robocopy "%source%" "%destination%" "%filename%" /njh /njs /ndl /nc /ns /np > nul

rem Needed because robocopy returns a non-zero code for success which makes Visual Studio treat this as failure.
