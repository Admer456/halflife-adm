# Miscellaneous Commands

The Half-Life Unified SDK adds commands and variables that can be used in the console.

Commands and cvars can be client or server side. Client commands are commands that clients can execute on the server. Not all commands are autocompleted by the console.

This list of commands and variables covers anything not part of a game system. See the documentation for game systems to view their related commands.

## Server-side commands

### sv_load_all_maps

Loads all maps and generates the node graph for them. This allows leaving the game running on its own and can also be used to generate a log containing any errors logged by the game.

## Server-side variables

### sv_schedule_debug

Syntax: `sv_schedule_debug <0|1>`

Controls whether schedule debugging is enabled. When enabled, if a schedule fails sparks will appear above an NPC and a `debug` message is printed on the `ent.ai` logger.

This cvar is enabled by default in debug builds to match the original behavior of this feature.
