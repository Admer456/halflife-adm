## Keyvalues

* **initial_capacity** - If set, this is the number of troops the Osprey will drop when it starts moving (up to **4** at a time). Otherwise the Osprey will count the number of troops in the map and will replenish them when they are killed. In both cases the Osprey will drop up to a maximum of **24** troops and will wait until they are killed to drop more
