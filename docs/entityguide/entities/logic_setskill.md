# logic_setskill

**Point entity**

Changes the skill level setting. Due to how the skill system works some changes will only take effect after a map change.

This entity is the equivalent of Quake 1's `trigger_setskill` but is a point entity that needs to be triggered. Its intended purpose is to be used in a campaign selection map.
