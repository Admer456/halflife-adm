# GameNetworkingSockets networking system

The Git branch `nonfunctional-prototype-networking` contains the prototype GameNetworkingSockets-based networking system. As the branch name implies this does not work, it has been added to show people how far its development got and which portions were finished and how.

There is some useful information to be gained from it, but there are no plans to continue its development since an alternative has been implemented.
